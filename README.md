# Scoop-on-the-Poop
A project that links a real-world interface to a SQL database using to Django, Python, and a Raspberry Pi to track and display the bathrooms breaks of my dogs on a webpage. This allows all members of my household to check if it is time for dogs to go out and eliminates the need for repetitive texting between household members.
